# epicode
Copied from adnanaziz/epicode since it is no longer maintained.  
This repo is used to practice C++ programming besides practicing for algorithm interview questions.


The codes will be heavily commented for any C++ syntax that I am not familiar with or any
algorithm design that I don't really understand.
